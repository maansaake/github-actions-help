# github-actions-help

A reference repository demonstrating GitHub Actions workflows for Go and Python applications. It includes two sample apps:

- `sample-go-app/` — a Go application with a Dockerfile
- `sample-py-app/` — a Python application

## Trigger workflows

### `main.yaml` — Main branch protection

**Trigger:** push to `main`

Orchestrates the core CI pipeline on every commit to `main`. Calls the three reusable workflows below:

1. `go.yaml` — build and test the Go app
2. `py.yaml` — set up Python and install dependencies
3. `image.yaml` — build the Docker image (does **not** push)

---

### `pull-request.yaml` — Pull request validation

**Trigger:** pull request targeting `main`

Runs the same pipeline as `main.yaml` to validate every PR before it can be merged:

1. `go.yaml` — build and test the Go app
2. `py.yaml` — set up Python and install dependencies
3. `image.yaml` — build the Docker image (does **not** push)

---

### `code-scanning.yaml` — Code scanning

**Trigger:** push to `main` and pull requests targeting `main`

Runs [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run/) (v2.12.0) against `sample-go-app/` and uploads the results as a SARIF report to GitHub code scanning (under Security → Code scanning). The upload step runs even if linting fails (`if: always()`).

---

### `auto-update-pr-branches.yaml` — Auto-update PR branches

**Trigger:** push to `main`

After every merge to `main`, iterates over all open PRs targeting `main` and rebases them onto the latest `main` using `gh pr update-branch --rebase`. This keeps PR branches up to date automatically.

Uses a GitHub App (Jeeves) for authentication so that the update triggers other required checks. Only runs in the `maansaake/github-actions-help` repository.

---

### `dependabot-auto-approve.yaml` — Dependabot auto-approve

**Trigger:** `pull_request_target` (opened, synchronize, reopened)

Automates merging of Dependabot PRs:

- **Minor and patch updates** — approves the PR and enables auto-merge (squash). If the PR is force-updated after a previous approval, re-approves it.
- **Major updates** — leaves a comment asking for manual review.

Uses a GitHub App (Jeeves) for authentication. Only runs for PRs authored by `dependabot[bot]` in the `maansaake/github-actions-help` repository.

---

## Reusable workflows

These workflows are not triggered directly; they are called by the trigger workflows above using `workflow_call`.

### `go.yaml` — Golang

Builds and tests `sample-go-app/` against both the **stable** and **oldstable** Go releases (matrix strategy), ensuring compatibility with the current and previous minor versions. Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Go (caching disabled at the action level — see below).
3. Cache Go modules (`~/go/pkg/mod`) and the build cache (`~/.cache/go-build`) with a `go-build-` prefix so older cache entries are reused when the exact SHA key misses.
4. Download dependencies (`go mod download`).
5. Run tests with coverage (`go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out`).
6. Generate an HTML coverage report.
7. Upload the coverage report as a workflow artifact (`go-coverage-report-<stable|oldstable>`).
8. Build the binary (`go build -o sample-go-app`).

> **Why is built-in caching disabled?** The `actions/setup-go` built-in cache keys on the hash of `go.sum`. That file only changes when dependencies change, not when application code changes, which can cause stale build-cache hits. This workflow instead uses `actions/cache` with a `github.sha`-based key and a shared `go-build-` restore prefix, so the build cache is always fresh for the current commit while still benefiting from earlier runs.

---

### `py.yaml` — Python

Sets up `sample-py-app/` for the configured Python version (currently `3.14`). Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Python with `pip` caching enabled.
3. Install dependencies from `sample-py-app/requirements.txt`.

---

### `image.yaml` — Image

Builds the Docker image for `sample-go-app/` and optionally pushes it to the GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io`).

**Triggers:** `workflow_call` (from `main.yaml` and `pull-request.yaml`) or directly on `release: published`. When triggered by the release event, `push` is automatically set to `true`.

Inputs (only applicable when called via `workflow_call`):

| Input | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | string | `"latest"` | Tag to apply to the image |
| `push` | boolean | `false` | Whether to push the image to the registry |

Steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Set up Docker Buildx.
3. Log in to `ghcr.io` using `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
4. Generate OCI-compliant image metadata (tags and labels) via `docker/metadata-action`.
5. Build (and push if `push: true`) the image from `sample-go-app/Dockerfile`, passing `VERSION=${{ github.sha }}` as a build argument.

A concurrency group (`image-build-<version>`) ensures that parallel image builds for the same version do not interfere with each other.

---

## Why `code-scanning.yaml` runs on both PRs and `main` pushes

GitHub code scanning treats pull request scans and branch scans as separate result streams, so both are needed for full coverage. Running on pull requests gives review-time feedback before merge, and running on `main` ensures the default branch always has fresh, authoritative alerts for Security reporting and branch-level visibility.

Keeping both triggers in the same workflow file ensures the exact same linting and SARIF upload logic is used in both contexts, which prevents drift and avoids mismatched scan behavior between pre-merge and post-merge checks.

## Dependabot configuration

`.github/dependabot.yml` configures Dependabot to open weekly grouped PRs for:

| Ecosystem | Directory |
|-----------|-----------|
| Go modules (`gomod`) | `/sample-go-app` |
| Python pip | `/sample-py-app` |
| Docker | `/sample-go-app` |
| GitHub Actions | `/` |

Updates are grouped into **minor** and **patch** buckets to reduce PR noise.
